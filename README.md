# Cardano Price Movements
Developed by: Carlos PÃ©rez Ricardo

Notebook to predict the correct time to buy Cardano and the correct time to sell. The model used is a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) which is an artificial recurrent neural network in the field of Deep Learning.

The problem is an imbalanced multi-class time series problem, LSTMs are capable of learning and finding patterns in time sequences in order to predict the target. 
The dataset is balanced with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

The accuracy in training is 96%. Let's see what is the score in test!

Thanks to NUWE for this dataset and this competition! It was a good opportunity to test new algorithms and get to know more about Deep Learning.
